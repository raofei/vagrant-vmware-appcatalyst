[Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com) provider for [VMware AppCatalyst®](https://communities.vmware.com/community/vmtn/devops/vmware-appcatalyst) [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/vagrant-vmware-appcatalyst.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/vagrant-vmware-appcatalyst) [![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/vmware/vagrant-vmware-appcatalyst?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge)
=============

This plugin supports `vmware_desktop`, `vmware_fusion` and `vmware_workstation` box type, the same used by Hashicorp plugins for VMware products.

Install
-------------

Latest version can be easily installed by running the following command:

```vagrant plugin install vagrant-vmware-appcatalyst```

Vagrant will download all the required gems during the installation process.

After the install has completed a ```vagrant up --provider=vmware_appcatalyst``` will trigger the newly installed provider.

*Note: The AppCatalyst Daemon must be running before bringing up a new vagrant box:*
```appcatalyst-daemon start```

Upgrade
-------------

If you already have vagrant-vmware-appcatalyst installed you can update to the latest version available by issuing:

```vagrant plugin update vagrant-vmware-appcatalyst```

Vagrant will take care of the upgrade process.

Configuration
-------------

Here's a sample Vagrantfile that builds a docker host on AppCatalyst and starts a Wordpress container on port 80, make sure you replace the placeholders with your own values.

```ruby
# Set our default provider for this Vagrantfile to 'vmware_appcatalyst'
ENV['VAGRANT_DEFAULT_PROVIDER'] = 'vmware_appcatalyst'

nodes = [
  { hostname: 'gantry-test-1', box: 'hashicorp/precise64' },
  { hostname: 'gantry-test-2', box: 'hashicorp/precise64' }
]

Vagrant.configure('2') do |config|

  # Configure our boxes with 1 CPU and 384MB of RAM
  config.vm.provider 'vmware_appcatalyst' do |v|
    v.cpus = '1'
    v.memory = '384'
  end

  # Go through nodes and configure each of them.j
  nodes.each do |node|
    config.vm.define node[:hostname] do |node_config|
      node_config.vm.box = node[:box]
      node_config.vm.hostname = node[:hostname]
      node_config.vm.synced_folder('/Users/frapposelli/Development', '/development')
    end
  end
end

```
